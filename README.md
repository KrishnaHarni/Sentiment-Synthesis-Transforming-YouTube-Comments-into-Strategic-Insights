# Sentiment Synthesis Transforming YouTube Comments into Strategic Insights

This project analyzes YouTube video comments to automatically classify them as Positive, Negative, and Neutral using the XML-RoBERTa transformer model. It includes live comment extraction, text preprocessing, sentiment classification, and result visualization. The goal is to understand public sentiment on a large scale and provide insights into community feedback through a fully automated pipeline.
